    <h2>
        Repository
    </h2>
    <p>
        A repository is a place Git stores all of your project files.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Clone
    </h2>
    <p>
        The clone action actually contains three jobs: download the library to the local, create 'origin' remote and point to the clone url for subsequent push, checkout initial branch.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Branch
    </h2>
    <p>
        The branch is to save the entire process of modifying the record. Branches after forks are not affected by other branches, so multiple modifications can be made simultaneously in the same database.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Master Branch
    </h2>
    <p>
        After the initial commit of the database, Git creates a branch called master. Therefore, subsequent commits are added to the master branch before switching branches.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Merge
    </h2>
    <p>
        Use merge to merge multiple history processes.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Pull
    </h2>
    <p>
        Execute pull to get the history of the remote database. You can merge by executing pull. At this point, if there are no conflicting changes, the merge commit is automatically created. If there is a conflict, resolve the conflict first and submit it manually.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Push
    </h2>
    <p>
        Push from local database to remote database
    </p>

    <h2>
        Fork
    </h2>
    <p>
        Fork in GitHub is the server-side code repository clone
    </p>

    <h2>
        checkout
    </h2>
    <p>
        The common use of checkout is to switch the working branch.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Remote Add / Remove / Show
    </h2>
    <p>
      The git remote show command plus the host name allows you to view the details of the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      The git remote add command is used to add a remote host.
    </p>
    <p>
      The git remote rm command is used to delete a remote host.y
    </p>

    <h2>
        Status
    </h2>
    <p>
        Git status can be used to view the status of the repository
    </p>
